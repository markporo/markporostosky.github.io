            <!--Paragraph about Beatrice-->
            <p>
                This Calico is among the softest creatures alive. Her looks will make you want to curl up in a ball and love her forever, but neither will she satisfy her sorcery. If you're not careful this cat will manipulate you into doing everything for her. She's
                great at tearing through loose material of any kind. Her agility and jumping power is impressive, but don't be surprised if you find her trapped in a closet somewhere. She's lovable, but beware! Her love back has limits.
