                <!--Description of Charlie-->
                <p>
                    Charlie might seem like an ordinary house dog, but he's not. He wears sweaters
                    and he will snuggle with you when you sleep. He protects the backyard
                    from something. We don't know what, but it happens. Charlie doesn't have
                    any real super powers. In fact his running limits to about a mile, but Charlie will love you
                    regardless of who you are. Just give him a treat and he's yours forever. Well, Sometimes.
